Types

Supervised Learning :

    - Labelled data. Data will be labelled and be fed to the system.

Unsupervised :

    - System will automatically group and label data based on similarity between the data

Reinforcedment learning :

    - feedbacks from the working system trains itself to categorise data. Predicts the data with the similarities found while running.
    - not trained beforehand unlike both Supervised and Unsupervised


Algorithms to be used depend on the data that we are to analyse.
