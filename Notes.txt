Types

Supervised Learning :

    - Labelled data. Data will be labelled and be fed to the system.

Unsupervised :

    - System will automatically group and label data based on similarity between the data

Reinforcedment learning :

    - feedbacks from the working system trains itself to categorise data. Predicts the data with the similarities found while running.
    - not trained beforehand unlike both Supervised and Unsupervised


Algorithms to be used depend on the data that we are to analyse.


Preprocess data : before training

numpy : array creation
sklearn : machine learning Algorithms


import numpy as np 
from sklearn import preprocessing

array creation : np.array([<rows>],[<rows>])

input_data.mean(axis=0) for mean
input_data.std(axis=0) for standard deviation

data_standardised = preprocessing.scale(input_data) : to standardise

data_scaled = data_scaler.fit_transform(input_data) : MinMax Scaling

normaliser scaling : L1, L2 
                     L1 - least absolute deviation
                            - result of normalisation is array, wit each rows absolute value is 1
                     l2 - least squares
                            - sum of squares of results each corresponding element of rows will be 1

Binarization : Depending on the threashold data, value will be binarised to 0 or 1 if the data is below or above the threashold respectevely.
binarizer

Labels : Fit and transform

Fit : One side conversions
Transform : Can tranform as well as inverse transform
