Types

Supervised Learning :

    - Labelled data. Data will be labelled and be fed to the system.

Unsupervised :

    - System will automatically group and label data based on similarity between the data

Reinforcedment learning :

    - feedbacks from the working system trains itself to categorise data. Predicts the data with the similarities found while running.
    - not trained beforehand unlike both Supervised and Unsupervised


Algorithms to be used depend on the data that we are to analyse.


Preprocess data : before training

numpy : array creation
sklearn : machine learning Algorithms


import numpy as np 
from sklearn import preprocessing

array creation : np.array([<rows>],[<rows>])

input_data.mean(axis=0) for mean
input_data.std(axis=0) for standard deviation

data_standardised = preprocessing.scale(input_data) : to standardise

data_scaled = data_scaler.fit_transform(input_data) : MinMax Scaling
